      "FishBase is an electronic encyclopedia founded in 1990 based on catalog cards of commercially important fish (www.fishbase.org; Froese & Pauly, 2024). Today, FishBase provides biological and ecological information on 35.800 species of marine and freshwater fish, with approximately 330.300 common names associated with these species, 65.100 photographs, 63.000 references, 2.550 contributors worldwide, and receives around 700.000 visits per month.",
      "The Annual FishBaseâ€¯&â€¯SeaLifeBase Symposium is the leading gathering of researchers, resource managers, and conservationists who use the worldâ€™s largest databases on fish and marine organisms, bringing together scientific presentations, workshops, and roundtable discussions on taxonomy, ecology, population modeling, and the sustainable use of aquatic ecosystems. Held since 2003, the event is taking place this year for the first time in Brazil, offering a unique opportunity for exchange between national and international experts to discuss the challenges and opportunities of Brazilâ€™s coastal and inland ecosystemsâ€”from mangroves and reefs to the Amazon basins."
